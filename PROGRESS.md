## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why These Puzzles?
- **Memory Tapestry**: Shows drag-and-drop + categorization
- **Neural Maze**: Shows keyboard controls + collection
- **Love Harvest**: Shows connection/matching + AI art
- **Vow Ritual**: Shows timing + multi-agent interaction

### Why This Tech Stack?
- **Next.js**: Fast, modern, easy deployment
- **Framer Motion**: Beautiful animations without video files
- **Groq API**: Free, fast AI inference
- **MCP**: Demonstrates extensibility

### What Makes It "Frankenstein"?
1. 5 AI agents with different personalities (incompatible worldviews)
2. Built with different Kiro paradigms (vibe + spec)
3. MCP servers extending capabilities (blockchain + image + memory)
4. All stitched together into one emergent family

## 🏆 Winning Strategy

### What Judges Will See:
1. **Unique concept**: AI ghosts debating player choices
2. **Technical depth**: Real MCP integration, not just API calls
3. **Polish**: Beautiful animations, smooth gameplay
4. **All 5 Kiro features**: Comprehensively demonstrated
5. **Emergent behavior**: AI responses create unique stories

### Demo Video Structure (3 min):
- 0:00-0:30: Project overview + Frankenstein pitch
- 0:30-1:00: Code walkthrough (agent specs, MCP servers)
- 1:00-2:00: Gameplay demo (show all puzzles)
- 2:00-2:30: Agent debate highlight (the star feature!)
- 2:30-3:00: Kiro features recap + closing

## 📝 Notes

- Keep puzzles simple but polished
- Focus on AI agent interaction (the unique selling point)
- Don't over-engineer - finish is better than perfect
- Test on different browsers before submitting
- Have fun! This is a creative project, not a job
