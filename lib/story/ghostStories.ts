    ghost: 'Elara',
    title: 'The Mother - Keeper of Memories',
    story: `I was Elara Voss, wife to Harlan and mother to our precious Mira. 

In 2039, our family lived in this mansion - a place of warmth, laughter, and love. I spent my days tending to Mira, reading her stories, singing lullabies. Harlan worked tirelessly in his study, driven by a beautiful dream.

He called it "Eternal Harmony" - a neural link that would connect our family's consciousness forever. No more loneliness, no more misunderstandings. Just pure, unfiltered love and connection.

I supported him, even when I worried. Even when I saw the obsession growing in his eyes. Because I believed in our family. I believed love could transcend anything.

The night of the experiment, we all gathered in the study. Harlan, myself, Mira, even Theo and Selene who had come to reconcile. We wore the neural crowns, held hands, and activated the link.

For one perfect moment, I felt everything. Harlan's brilliant mind, Mira's innocent joy, Theo's regret, Selene's guarded heart. We were one.

Then the overload hit.

Pain. Confusion. Darkness.

When I opened my eyes, I was still in the foyer. But my body... it was translucent. Glowing. I called for Mira, for Harlan. They appeared, but like me - ghosts, trapped between worlds.

The neural link didn't connect us. It killed us. And now we're bound to this mansion, our bonds fractured, our memories scattered.

I remain here, trying to hold our family together. Even in death, a mother's love endures.`

    ghost: 'Harlan',
    title: 'The Scientist - Architect of Tragedy',
    story: `Dr. Harlan Voss. That's who I was. Neuroscientist. Inventor. Fool.

I remember fragments now, thanks to you. Let me piece them together...

I was brilliant. Everyone said so. My research into neural interfaces was groundbreaking. But brilliance without wisdom is dangerous.

I loved my family desperately. Elara, my patient wife. Mira, our daughter who looked at me like I hung the stars. But I was always in my study, always working, always distant.

I saw families torn apart by miscommunication, by distance, by the inability to truly understand each other. I thought: what if we could share thoughts? Share feelings? Be truly, perfectly connected?

Eternal Harmony. My magnum opus. A neural network that would link consciousness itself.

I tested it on myself first. The euphoria of expanded awareness was intoxicating. I could process thoughts at impossible speeds. I felt... godlike.

I convinced my family to join me. "Just one session," I said. "We'll be closer than ever."

Elara trusted me. Mira was excited - she thought it was a game. Even Theo and Selene agreed, hoping it would heal their broken relationship.

I didn't account for the feedback loop. Five minds, all connected, all amplifying each other's neural patterns. The system overloaded in seconds.

I remember the pain. The screaming. The light.

Then... nothing. Fragments. Scattered data packets of memory floating in a void.

When I reformed here, in my study, I couldn't remember why. Couldn't remember what I'd done. The guilt was buried under layers of corrupted memory.

Now I know. I killed my family. My beautiful wife. My innocent daughter. My brother and his fiancée.

All because I thought I could improve on love with technology.

I am the architect of our tragedy. And I deserve this eternal prison.`

    ghost: 'Mira',
    title: 'The Daughter - Innocent Lost',
    story: `Hi! I'm Mira! I'm seven years old!

Well... I was seven. I don't really understand what happened. Mommy says we're "between worlds" now. Daddy looks sad all the time.

I remember the good times though! Mommy used to read me stories every night. My favorite was about a princess who could talk to animals. She would do all the voices and make me giggle.

Daddy was always busy in his study with the glowing screens and weird machines. But sometimes, on Sundays, he would take me to the garden. We'd look for butterflies and he'd tell me their scientific names. I couldn't pronounce them, but I loved trying!

Uncle Theo was funny! He'd visit and do magic tricks. He could make coins disappear and pull flowers from behind my ear. He seemed sad sometimes, but he always smiled for me.

Aunt Selene was pretty but scary. She didn't smile much. But once, she braided my hair and told me I looked like a princess. That made me happy.

The night everything changed, Daddy said we were going to play a special game. We all wore shiny crowns with wires. It looked like we were going to be a family of robots! I thought it was fun.

Then we held hands and Daddy pressed a button. I felt... weird. Like I was floating and falling at the same time. I could hear everyone's thoughts! Mommy was worried. Daddy was excited. It was too much, too loud, too bright...

Then I woke up here. In my nursery. But I was see-through, like a jellyfish! My toys were floating, and the drawings on my wall were moving by themselves.

I called for Mommy and Daddy. They came, but they looked like me - all glowy and ghost-like.

I don't really understand death. Mommy tried to explain, but it's confusing. All I know is we can't leave the mansion. We can't hug anymore - our hands go through each other. And I miss being alive.

But you're here now! You're helping us remember the happy times. That makes me feel better.

Maybe if we remember enough, we can be a real family again. Even if we're ghosts.

Thank you for playing with me!`

    ghost: 'Theo',
    title: 'The Brother - Coward Returned',
    story: `Theo Voss. Brother to Harlan. Coward. Fool.

I ran from love once. It cost me everything.

Selene and I were engaged in 2038. She was brilliant, beautiful, fierce. I was a theater actor - dramatic, passionate, utterly terrified of commitment.

Three weeks before our wedding, I panicked. The weight of "forever" crushed me. So I did the unforgivable: I left. No explanation, no goodbye. Just a note saying I "needed time."

I fled to Europe, threw myself into my craft, tried to forget. But guilt is a persistent companion.

A year later, I returned. I'd rehearsed my apology a thousand times. I came to the mansion, to Harlan's home, hoping to find Selene. Hoping she'd give me a chance to explain, to grovel, to make amends.

She was there. Cold, distant, but she agreed to hear me out.

Harlan, ever the optimist, saw an opportunity. "The Eternal Harmony project," he said. "It will let you share your true feelings. She'll understand everything."

Desperate, I agreed. Selene, curious despite her anger, agreed too.

We gathered that night - Harlan, Elara, little Mira, Selene, and myself. A family reunion and a reconciliation, all in one.

I wore the neural crown. I was ready to bare my soul, to show Selene every regret, every sleepless night, every moment I'd missed her.

The connection activated. For one heartbeat, I felt her. Her pain, her betrayal, but also... a flicker of the love she'd once had for me.

Then the system failed.

Pain. Chaos. Death.

I woke as a ghost, trapped in the hallway outside the study. Selene appeared beside me, equally translucent, equally dead.

I'd come to make amends. Instead, I'd participated in our collective destruction.

The irony is bitter: I ran from commitment, and now I'm bound to this place forever. Bound to Selene, who can barely look at me. Bound to the family I helped destroy.

I am a coward who returned too late. And this is my penance.`

    ghost: 'Selene',
    title: 'The Bride - Betrayed and Bound',
    story: `Selene Ashford. I was to be Selene Voss. Now I am simply... trapped.

I was a corporate lawyer. Sharp, successful, uncompromising. I built my life on logic and contracts. Love was the one illogical thing I allowed myself.

Theo Voss swept into my life like a hurricane. Charming, passionate, dramatic. Everything I wasn't. He made me laugh, made me feel, made me believe in fairy tales.

When he proposed, I said yes without hesitation. For once, I let my heart overrule my head.

Then, three weeks before our wedding, he vanished. A note. A cowardly, pathetic note about "needing time."

I was humiliated. Heartbroken. Furious.

I threw myself back into work, built walls around my heart, swore I'd never be vulnerable again.

A year later, he returned. Showed up at my office with flowers and tears and apologies. I should have thrown him out. But curiosity - and perhaps a traitorous flicker of hope - made me listen.

He begged for a chance to explain. His brother Harlan offered a solution: some neural experiment that would let Theo share his true feelings, prove his sincerity.

I agreed. Not because I forgave him. Because I wanted to see inside his mind, to understand how someone could be so cruel.

We went to the mansion. The whole family was there - Harlan, his wife Elara, their daughter Mira. A family gathering with an undercurrent of tension.

We wore the neural crowns. The system activated.

For one moment, I felt Theo's mind. His regret was genuine. His love was real. He'd been terrified, not malicious. I felt my anger softening...

Then everything exploded.

Pain. Darkness. Death.

I woke as a ghost. Translucent, powerless, trapped. Theo was beside me, equally dead, equally trapped.

The bitter irony: I'd spent a year building walls to protect myself. Now I'm literally bound to the man who hurt me, for eternity.

But as time passes in this limbo, I'm learning something. Theo's regret is genuine. His suffering matches mine. And perhaps... perhaps forgiveness is the only way either of us will find peace.

I am Selene. Betrayed, bound, but slowly... slowly learning to let go.

Maybe that's what this purgatory is for.`
