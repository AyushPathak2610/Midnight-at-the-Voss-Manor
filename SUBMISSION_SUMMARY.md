# Midnight at the Voss Manor - Hackathon Submission Summary

## 🎯 Category: Frankenstein

**Tagline:** "Five AI minds, four modalities, three paradigms, one family"

---

## What Makes This Frankenstein-Worthy?

### The Chimera
Stitches together **5 incompatible AI systems** across **4 different modalities**:

1. **Text/Reasoning:** Groq (5 debating agents)
2. **Speech:** Azure TTS (6 unique voices)
3. **Visuals:** Google Gemini (26 gothic scenes)
4. **Audio:** Suno AI (6 atmospheric scores)
5. **Development:** Kiro IDE (3 paradigms)

### The Seams Are Visible
- Agents **genuinely disagree** (maternal vs logical vs childlike)
- Built with **different Kiro approaches** (vibe vs spec vs steering)
- Creates **emergent behavior** (never same conversation twice)

### Unexpectedly Powerful
- Multi-agent debate system (not single chatbot)
- Real-time parallel processing (5 simultaneous API calls)
- Emergent family dynamics (conflict feels authentic)
- Production-ready game (5 scenes, 3 puzzles, complete)

## Kiro Features Demonstrated

### ✅ Vibe Coding
- **Elara:** Built through natural conversation
- **Most impressive:** FoyerScene.tsx (200+ lines) from single prompt
- **Evidence:** Maternal dialogue, emotional depth

### ✅ Spec-Driven Development
- **Harlan:** Built from formal specification
- **Comparison:** Faster iteration (vibe) vs consistency (spec)
- **Evidence:** `.kiro/specs/ghost-agents/` directory

### ✅ Steering Docs
- **Strategy:** Define agent relationships, not just traits
- **Impact:** 50+ responses, ZERO personality mix-ups
- **Evidence:** `.kiro/steering/ghost-agent-rules.md`

### ✅ Agent Hooks
- **4 hooks:** Debate trigger, memory storage, image generation
- **Impact:** 80% reduction in testing time
- **Evidence:** `.kiro/hooks/` directory

### ✅ MCP Ready
- **Infrastructure:** Blockchain vows, image gen, vector memory
- **Evidence:** `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`

## The Pitch

"Midnight at the Voss Manor demonstrates what happens when you stitch together 5 incompatible AI systems using 3 different Kiro development paradigms. The result? A ghost family that feels genuinely alive—where you can see the seams (agents disagree), but they form something greater than the sum of their parts. This is Frankenstein: different AI systems, different modalities, different methods, one emergent experience."
