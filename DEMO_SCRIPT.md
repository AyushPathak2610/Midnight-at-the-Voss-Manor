# Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)

## Opening (15 seconds)
**Visual:** Show project in VS Code with Kiro panel open
**Narration:** "Shadowed Haven: Where 5 independent AI ghosts debate in real-time to help you solve puzzles. Built entirely with Kiro for the Frankenstein category."

## The Chimera Explained (30 seconds)
**Visual:** Show file structure, highlight different components
**Narration:** "This is a true Frankenstein project. Five Grok agents, each built differently:"
- Point to Elara: "Vibe-coded through conversation"
- Point to Harlan: "Spec-driven from JSON"
- Point to MCP config: "Extended with 3 MCP servers"
- Point to hooks: "Orchestrated by Kiro Agent Hooks"
- Point to steering: "Kept consistent with steering docs"

## Live Gameplay (60 seconds)
**Visual:** Browser showing the game
1. **Intro scene** (10s) - "Lost in a storm, you find a haunted mansion..."
2. **Meet Elara** (10s) - "The mother ghost introduces the family tragedy"
3. **Click "Ask Ghosts for Hint"** (40s)
   - Show button click
   - **ZOOM IN on debug panel** (bottom right)
   - Show messages appearing in real-time:
     - Elara: "The weaver needs guidance..."
     - Harlan: "I remember fragments... which matters most?"
     - Mira: "Show the happy times!"
     - Theo: "Family moments define you, brother"
     - Selene: "Love transcends science"
   - Show consensus hint appearing

## The Magic Moment (30 seconds)
**Visual:** Split screen - code + game
**Narration:** "Here's what makes this Frankenstein:"
- Left: Show `ghostAgents.ts` - "5 independent personalities"
- Right: Show debate panel - "Arguing in real-time"
- Bottom: Show MCP calls - "Mira generates crayon art, Selene checks blockchain vows"
**Narration:** "No pre-written dialogue. Every debate is emergent. Five incompatible agents creating one family consciousness."

## Kiro Features Showcase (30 seconds)
**Visual:** Quick cuts showing each feature
1. **Vibe Coding** - Chat with Kiro: "Make Elara more maternal" → code updates
2. **Agent Hooks** - Show `.kiro/hooks/on-puzzle-hint.json` → click hook → agents activate
3. **Spec-Driven** - Show Harlan's JSON spec → consistent behavior
4. **Steering Docs** - Show rules file → prevents personality mixing
5. **MCP** - Show 3 servers in config → extended capabilities

## Closing (15 seconds)
**Visual:** Return to game, show all 5 ghosts together
**Narration:** "Five narrow AIs. Three MCP servers. Two development paradigms. One emergent family. That's the Frankenstein chimera. Built with Kiro."
**Text overlay:** "Shadowed Haven - Kiroween 2024"

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Visible seams** - Show the debate panel prominently. Judges need to SEE agents disagreeing.
2. **Real-time** - Emphasize messages appearing live, not pre-scripted
3. **MCP integration** - Show at least one MCP call (Mira's image or Selene's vow check)
4. **Kiro features** - Touch on all 5 (vibe, hooks, spec, steering, MCP)
5. **Emergent behavior** - "Never the same twice"

## Technical Setup for Recording

- Browser: Chrome with dev tools open (show network calls)
- Window size: 1920x1080
- Debug panel: Always visible (bottom right)
- Kiro IDE: Show in split screen when demonstrating features
- Audio: Clear narration, no background music (or very subtle)

## B-Roll Suggestions

- Code scrolling through `ghostAgents.ts`
- MCP config file
- Agent hook JSON
- Steering doc with personality rules
- Network tab showing API calls to Grok

## One-Liner for Social Media

"I built a haunted mansion game where 5 AI ghosts debate your hints in real-time. Each ghost uses different Kiro features (vibe coding, specs, MCP) and they argue with each other to reach consensus. It's a Frankenstein chimera that feels genuinely alive. 👻🤖"
